# ToDO

This is a simple decenterlized application (Dapp) built on Goerli testnet using ethers and hardhat. 

In this application user can add task, update the priority and delete it.


## Demo

https://todo-nu-beige.vercel.app/


## Features

- User could add task to the created List 

- Priority of task could be set

- If task is completed it could be deleted
## Tech Stack
The frontend is built using React

On the Web3 side, the contract is written in Solidity and compiled deployed using hardhat. 

In this app Simply deployed smart contract using goerli testnet

For interaction with frontend ether.js library is used
## Limitations

- The most prominent limitation of this ToDo system is that it's proper functioning is heavily dependent on how it's going to be interacted with. The buttons are not turned off (i.e. made un-clickable) at any moment. So, if a participant decides to just go ahead and randomly start clicking the buttons in between transactions, the application is mostly likely going to report an error or even worse, it may crash. Therefore, patiently wait for the transaction to complete and the updates to appear on screen

- If once task is completed and user deletes it, the priority would be set to 0
 
- User should set the priority starting from 1
